He can choose to get his new puppy either from the pet store or the pound. The probability of him going to the pet store is $0.2$. 

He can choose to get either a big, medium or small puppy.

If he goes to the pet store, the probability of him getting a small puppy is $0.6$. The probability of him getting a medium puppy is $0.3$, and the probability of him getting a large puppy is $0.1$.

If he goes to the pound, the probability of him getting a small puppy is $0.1$. The probability of him getting a medium puppy is $0.35$, and the probability of him getting a large puppy is $0.55$.
