### Med Question

A medical test is designed to diagnose a certain disease. The test has a false positive rate of 10%, meaning that 10% of people without the disease will get a positive test result. The test has a false negative rate of 2%, meaning that 2% of people with the disease will get a negative result. Only 1% of the population has this disease.


#### 3) If a patient receives a positive test result, what is the probability that they actually have the disease? Show how you arrive at your answer.
